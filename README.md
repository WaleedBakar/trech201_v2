## DevOps

## Ease of use-  Other teams are going to ise the tools we cerate. they wont use them if they are not user friendly.

## flexibility - it ca be easy to get locked in to using a specific product tool or softrware. and then it becomes hard for them to keep up with industy changes .

## Robustness -  we need as close to 100% uptime as possible for our company services 

## Cost -  cost is often overlooked we nned to make sure the company is being effcient as possible in its trch dealings.  for example how powerful a machine do we need to conduct a task. Do we nned curtain servers running? ect.
