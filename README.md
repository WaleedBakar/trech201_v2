## DevOps

## Ease of use-  Other teams are going to ise the tools we cerate. they wont use them if they are not user friendly.

## flexibility - it ca be easy to get locked in to using a specific product tool or softrware. and then it becomes hard for them to keep up with industy changes .

## Robustness -  we need as close to 100% uptime as possible for our company services 

## Cost -  cost is often overlooked we nned to make sure the company is being effcient as possible in its trch dealings.  for example how powerful a machine do we need to conduct a task. Do we nned curtain servers running? ect.

## Infrastructure and architecture

  Monolithic applications consist of a single codebase that interacts with a single database. The application's client interface, single database, frontend, backend and business logic are incorporated into one codebase. There is only one test and deployment pipeline to maintain.

Microservices - Microservices architecture is tailor-made for DevOps with its services-based approach that allows organizations to break down the application into smaller services. This enables delivery teams to tackle individual services as separate entitiesâ€”ultimately simplifying the development, testing, and deployment.
