## DevOps

## Ease of use-  Other teams are going to ise the tools we cerate. they wont use them if they are not user friendly.

## flexibility - it ca be easy to get locked in to using a specific product tool or softrware. and then it becomes hard for them to keep up with industy changes .

## Robustness -  we need as close to 100% uptime as possible for our company services 

## Cost -  cost is often overlooked we nned to make sure the company is being effcient as possible in its trch dealings.  for example how powerful a machine do we need to conduct a task. Do we nned curtain servers running? ect.

## Risk manager 


    Thread agents. This element describes which users to watch out for which pose a threat to your application.
    Attack vectors and scenarios. Describes which kind of attacks are to be expected.
    Detectability. Answers the question of how easy the risk/weak spot can be found by attackers.
    Exploitability. Describes how widespread the vulnerability is and how easy it is to exploit it.
    Impacts. This element describes the impact on the business and technical architecture.


## Infrastructure and architecture

  Monolithic applications consist of a single codebase that interacts with a single database. The application's client interface, single database, frontend, backend and business logic are incorporated into one codebase. There is only one test and deployment pipeline to maintain.

Microservices - Microservices architecture is tailor-made for DevOps with its services-based approach that allows organizations to break down the application into smaller services. This enables delivery teams to tackle individual services as separate entitiesâ€”ultimately simplifying the development, testing, and deployment.

# DevEnvironments 
  A DevOps development environment should not only edit and debug code, but integrate with the rest of the DevOps cycle, including testing, version control, and production monitoring. Microsoft provides two major development environments to support DevOps, Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code. Allows teams to be standarised and increases development teams worklfow if everyone works in the same environment.

     rdp             connects to machine via RDP
     rebuild         plugin: vagrant-digitalocean: destroys and ups the vm with the same ip address
     reload          restarts vagrant machine, loads new Vagrantfile configuration
     resume          resume a suspended vagrant machine
     share           share your Vagrant environment with anyone in the world
     snapshot        manages snapshots: saving, restoring, etc.
     ssh             connects to machine via SSH
     ssh-config      outputs OpenSSH valid configuration to connect to the machine
     status          outputs status of the vagrant machine
     suspend         suspends the machine
     up              starts and provisions the vagrant environment
